It integrates fundamental front-end development skills, utilizing **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to create an interactive user experience. The application communicates with the public **TheCocktailDB API** as its dynamic data source, ensuring a varied question set across multiple sessions.

The SPA guides the user through an animated start sequence, allows category selection, presents timed questions with immediate feedback, tracks the score, and provides a review of incorrect answers upon completion, culminating in a confetti celebration for high scores.

**Steps:**

**1. Clone the Repository:**
   * Open your terminal or command prompt.
   * Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project (e.g., your Desktop or a dedicated 'projects' folder) using the `cd` (change directory) command.
